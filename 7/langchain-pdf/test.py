a = '''Spain and Portugal were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and other valuable products
from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main reasons that
Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama sailed to India in 1499.[8] When da Gama discovered the pepper
market in India, he was able to secure peppers for a much cheaper price than the ones demanded by
Venice.[14] At around the same time, Christopher Columbus returned from the New World. He described to
investors the new spices available there.
Another source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th centuries was the Ragusans from
the maritime republic of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia.[17] The military prowess of Afonso de
Albuquerque (1453â€“1515) allowed the Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he
took the island of Socotra in the mouth of the Red Sea and, in 1507, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf. Since
becoming the viceroy of the Indies, he took Goa in India in 1510, and Malacca on the Malay peninsula in
1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with Siam, China, and the Maluku Islands.
With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including allspice, chili peppers, vanilla, and
chocolate. This development kept the spice trade, with America as a latecomer with its new seasonings,
profitable well into the 19th centur'''.__len__()
